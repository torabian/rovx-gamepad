# RovX Gamepad

React Native based gamepad, joystick which can be used for RC projects. Integrates with RovX server. You can use this gamepad for your own project, if you need to customize it.


## Setup
We are not providing the release into any kind of store. It's a part of our roadmap. Until then:

You can clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/torabian/rovx-gamepad
```

and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

For more information, you need to look at the "React Native" project guidelines from facebook. We do not eject their project, so all instructions there would work here as well.
